# RPA Lab 1

This repository contains two UiPath projects: **Classic** and **FirstBot**.

Both projects perform an automation process where the robot:
1. Opens a web browser.
2. Searches for the weather information of a specific city.
3. Extracts the temperature and humidity values from the webpage.
4. Writes the collected data into a Notepad file.
5. Saves the Notepad file inside the same project folder.
